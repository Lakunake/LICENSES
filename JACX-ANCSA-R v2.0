JACX Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike Relinking License (JACX-ANCSA-R) — Version 2.0

Short name: JACX-ANCSA-R v2.0
Copyright © 2025 Lakunake

Preamble
--------
This license combines Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike principles for creative materials with relinking and source-availability protections for software components. Version 2.0 addresses ambiguities in version 1.1 by providing explicit definitions, clear classification rules, specific procedural requirements, and improved compatibility guidance.

This license is provided as a user-draft for practical implementation. It is not legal advice. Organizations should consult qualified legal counsel before adopting this license for significant projects. Combining NonCommercial restrictions with software relinking requirements creates inherent distribution and compatibility challenges that may limit adoption in commercial ecosystems and package management systems.

For projects requiring broader distribution, consider licensing creative assets and software components under separate, established licenses such as Creative Commons for assets and Mozilla Public License or Lesser General Public License for code.

License Terms
-------------
By obtaining, using, copying, modifying, or distributing any portion of the Work, you expressly agree to all terms of the JACX Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike Relinking License version 2.0. If you do not agree to these terms in their entirety, you have no rights to use, copy, modify, or distribute the Work in any form. Partial acceptance is not permitted.

The following sections define the complete scope of rights, obligations, limitations, and procedures under this license.

0. Definitions
-------------
**"Work"** means all files, code, assets, media, documentation, and other materials that the Licensor distributes under this license, whether in source or object form.

**"Licensed Material"** means the portions of the Work that constitute creative works including but not limited to artwork, audio recordings, music compositions, video content, textual content, three-dimensional models, textures, animations, design documents, and similar creative assets. Licensed Material is governed by the Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike provisions in Sections 1, 4, 5, and 7.

**"Covered Code"** means the portions of the Work that constitute software including but not limited to source code files, compiled executables, libraries, scripts, build configurations, linking instructions, and compilation toolchains. Covered Code is governed by the relinking and source-availability provisions in Sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.

**"Hybrid Components"** means Work components that contain both Licensed Material and Covered Code in a manner that cannot be cleanly separated. For classification purposes, any component containing executable instructions, bytecode, or machine code shall be classified as Covered Code regardless of embedded assets. Purely data-driven components such as JSON configuration files, XML schemas, or CSV datasets that contain no executable logic shall be classified as Licensed Material. When uncertainty exists, the component shall be treated as Covered Code to ensure maximum recipient rights.

**"You," "Your," or "Recipient"** means any natural person or legal entity exercising rights under this license. For legal entities, "You" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with that entity. "Control" means direct or indirect ownership of more than fifty percent of voting interests or decision-making authority.

**"Adapted Material"** means any material subject to copyright that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material or modified Covered Code, including translations, derivative works, transformations, remixes, modifications, enhancements, or any other alterations requiring permission under applicable copyright law.

**"Modified"** means any change to the Work including additions, deletions, alterations to functionality, corrections, enhancements, optimizations, translations to different programming languages, or any other modification requiring permission under applicable copyright law.

**"NonCommercial"** means not primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage, private monetary compensation, or financial gain. NonCommercial uses expressly include:
- Personal use, experimentation, and hobby projects without revenue generation;
- Academic research, teaching, and educational use at accredited nonprofit institutions;
- Use by registered charitable organizations for their charitable purposes;
- Government use for public sector purposes;
- Internal use by for-profit entities for research and development purposes where the Work is not incorporated into commercial products or services.

NonCommercial uses expressly exclude:
- Incorporation into products or services offered for sale, license, or subscription;
- Use to provide commercial services including software-as-a-service, hosting services, or consulting services;
- Use in advertising-supported platforms where the Work contributes to revenue generation;
- Distribution by commercial entities through paid channels;
- Use by for-profit entities where the Work is integrated into revenue-generating operations;
- Charging fees beyond Direct Distribution Costs as defined below;
- Any use where monetary compensation is received in connection with the Work, directly or indirectly, except as specifically permitted herein.

When uncertainty exists regarding whether a use qualifies as NonCommercial, the use shall be presumed commercial unless the Recipient obtains written clarification from the Licensor.

**"ShareAlike"** means that Adapted Material must be distributed under identical license terms as the original Work, specifically this JACX-ANCSA-R license at the same or later version, preserving all recipient rights including attribution, access to source, and relinking capabilities.

**"Direct Distribution Costs"** means the actual, documented, reasonable costs directly attributable to physical or electronic distribution including media costs, shipping fees, bandwidth charges, and infrastructure costs necessary for distribution. Direct Distribution Costs expressly exclude labor costs, overhead, profit margins, development costs, and any other indirect costs.

**"Source Form"** means the preferred form for making modifications including human-readable source code, configuration files, interface definitions, build scripts, and any other materials necessary to understand and modify the Work.

**"Object Form"** means any compiled, transformed, or processed form of the Work including compiled binaries, bytecode, minified code, obfuscated code, and any other form that is not Source Form.

**"Corresponding Source"** means all Source Form necessary to compile, build, install, and execute the Covered Code including source files, build scripts, compilation instructions, interface definitions, configuration files, and any libraries or tools required for building that are not commonly available in standard development environments. Corresponding Source must be in a format that enables modification and recompilation by Recipients with ordinary technical skills.

**"Independent Module"** means a software component that satisfies all of the following technical requirements:
1. Is compiled or built separately from the Covered Code;
2. Communicates with the Covered Code exclusively through well-defined, documented interfaces such as function calls, APIs, network protocols, or inter-process communication;
3. Can be replaced with a functional equivalent without modifying the Covered Code;
4. Does not share object files, memory spaces, or compilation units with the Covered Code except through standard operating system facilities;
5. Performs a logically distinct function that is not merely a subdivision of functionality that would normally reside in the Covered Code.

Components that are designed to be compiled or linked together, share internal data structures, or require intimate knowledge of Covered Code internals do not qualify as Independent Modules.

**"Licensor"** means the copyright holder or holders who distribute the Work under this license, or any authorized agent acting on their behalf.

**"Commercial License"** means a separate agreement with the Licensor that permits commercial use, distribution, or exploitation of the Work under different terms than this license.

3. Source Availability Requirement (Covered Code)
------------------------------------------------
When You distribute Covered Code in Object Form or distribute any executable that contains or links to Covered Code, You must make the Corresponding Source available to all recipients by one of the following methods:

**Method A — Direct Distribution:**
Include the complete Corresponding Source with the Object Form distribution in a commonly used archive format. The Corresponding Source must be provided simultaneously with the Object Form distribution.

**Method B — Written Offer:**
Accompany the Object Form with a written offer that is permanent, irrevocable, and freely transferable to third parties, valid for at least three years from the date of distribution, to provide the complete Corresponding Source upon request. The offer must specify:
- A valid contact method including email address and postal address;

- Corresponding Source must be provided in the same manner and with the same level of access as the Object Form distribution.

**Prohibition on Obstruction:**
You must not impose legal or technical barriers that prevent or impede recipients from obtaining, building, or using the Corresponding Source. This includes but is not limited to restrictive licensing terms for build tools, geographical restrictions, throttling, paywalls, or deliberate obfuscation.

4. Attribution Requirement (All Work)
-------------------------------------
Every distribution, public display, or public performance of the Work, whether Licensed Material or Covered Code, whether in original or modified form, must include clear and reasonable attribution to the original author or authors.

**Minimum Attribution Requirements:**
Attribution must include all of the following information in a location and manner appropriate to the medium and distribution method:
1. The name or pseudonym of the original author or authors as specified by the Licensor;
2. The title or name of the Work as specified by the Licensor;
3. A Uniform Resource Locator or other reference to the original source if provided by the Licensor;
4. A copyright notice in the form "Copyright © [year] [author name]";
5. A notice that the Work is licensed under JACX-ANCSA-R v2.0 with reference to where the full license text can be obtained;
6. A notice of any modifications You have made, if any, with a brief description of the nature and extent of changes.

**Attribution Placement Standards:**

For Licensed Material distributed as standalone files, attribution must appear:
- In metadata fields if the file format supports metadata;
- In accompanying documentation files located in the same directory or archive;
- In credits sections if the material is incorporated into larger works such as games, films, or applications.

For Covered Code distributed in Source Form, attribution must appear:
- In header comments of source files;
- In a dedicated AUTHORS, CONTRIBUTORS, or CREDITS file in the root directory;
- In README or similar documentation files.

For Covered Code distributed in Object Form or as executables, attribution must appear:
- In an "About" dialog or credits screen if the software has a graphical interface;
- In command-line help output or documentation if the software is command-line based;
- In a separate text file distributed with the executable if no other interface exists;
- In the installer or distribution package description.

For web-based distributions or software-as-a-service deployments, attribution must appear:
- On a publicly accessible "About," "Credits," or "Licenses" page linked from the main interface;
- In page footers if the Work is incorporated into website content;
- In API documentation if the Work is provided as an API service.

**Visibility Standard:**
Attribution must be presented in a manner that is readily discoverable by ordinary users exercising ordinary usage patterns. Attribution buried in obscure log files, hidden configuration files, or locations requiring technical expertise to locate does not satisfy this requirement.

**Preservation Requirement:**
You must retain all existing copyright notices, license notices, warranty disclaimers, and attribution information present in the Work. You must not remove or alter any such notices except to add Your own notices for modifications You have made.

**Reasonable Implementation:**
The specific manner of attribution may vary based on the medium, distribution method, and practical constraints, but must satisfy the minimum requirements and visibility standards above. When uncertain about adequacy of attribution, contact the Licensor for clarification using the contact information in Section 13.

5. ShareAlike Requirement (Adapted Material and Modified Covered Code)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
To preserve recipient freedoms and ensure attribution and source availability continue through the distribution chain, You must apply ShareAlike terms to all Adapted Material and all modifications of Covered Code.

**For Adapted Material (Licensed Material):**
If You create, distribute, publicly display, or publicly perform Adapted Material based on Licensed Material, You must:
1. License the entire Adapted Material under this JACX-ANCSA-R license at version 2.0 or any later version published by the Licensor;
2. Include a copy of this license or a URL where it can be obtained;
3. Provide clear notice that the Adapted Material is licensed under JACX-ANCSA-R;
4. Comply with all attribution requirements in Section 4 for both the original Work and Your adaptations;
5. Not impose additional restrictions or terms that limit recipients' rights under this license.

**For Modified Covered Code:**
If You modify Covered Code and distribute the modified version in any form, You must:
1. License the entire modified Covered Code under this JACX-ANCSA-R license at version 2.0 or any later version published by the Licensor;
2. Make the Corresponding Source of Your modifications available according to Section 3;
3. Provide build and linking instructions for Your modifications;
4. Comply with all attribution requirements in Section 4;
5. Clearly mark Your modifications and provide a description of changes;
6. Not impose additional restrictions or terms that limit recipients' rights under this license.

**For Combinations with Other Software:**
When You combine or link Covered Code with other software components, the following rules apply:

*Independent Modules:*
Software components that qualify as Independent Modules under the definition in Section 0 may be licensed under different terms, provided those terms:
- Do not restrict recipients' ability to obtain Corresponding Source for the Covered Code portions;
- Do not impose technical or legal barriers to relinking or replacing the Covered Code portions;
- Do not prohibit NonCommercial distribution of the combined work;
- Are clearly identified with explicit notice of which components are under which licenses.

*Integrated Components:*
Software components that do not qualify as Independent Modules must be licensed under this JACX-ANCSA-R license and distributed with Corresponding Source and relinking capabilities as required by Sections 3 and 6.

**Determination of Independence:**
When uncertainty exists about whether a component qualifies as an Independent Module, You should:
1. Review the technical criteria in Section 0 carefully;
2. Document Your analysis and reasoning;
3. Err on the side of applying ShareAlike terms if substantial doubt exists;
4. Seek clarification from the Licensor using the contact information in Section 13.

**Downstream Obligations:**
You must ensure that all recipients of Adapted Material or Modified Covered Code receive clear notice of their rights under this license and have practical ability to exercise those rights including access to source, attribution information, and relinking capabilities.

6. Relinking and Interoperability Requirement (Covered Code)
-----------------------------------------------------------
To preserve recipients' rights to modify, recompile, and replace Covered Code components with modified versions, You must provide the technical means and legal permission for relinking when You distribute executables containing Covered Code.

**Relinking Obligation:**
If You distribute any executable program, application, library, or other binary that incorporates, contains, or links to Covered Code, You must enable recipients to relink the executable with modified versions of the Covered Code by satisfying at least one of the following methods:

**Method A — Source and Build Scripts:**
Provide all of the following:
1. The Corresponding Source for all components of the executable, including components that are not Covered Code;
2. Complete build scripts, makefiles, project files, and compilation instructions;
3. Linker scripts and linking instructions necessary to produce the executable;
4. Documentation of the build environment including compiler versions, tool versions, and platform requirements;
5. Any cryptographic keys, signatures, or authentication credentials required to install or execute the rebuilt binary on target platforms, or explicit notice that such restrictions do not exist.

**Method B — Separate Shared Library:**
Distribute the Covered Code as a separate shared library, dynamically linked library, or plugin with all of the following:
1. The shared library file with full debugging symbols and linking metadata;
2. Header files, interface definitions, or API documentation necessary to link against the library;
3. Example linking instructions demonstrating how to link a modified version;
4. Documentation of library dependencies and runtime requirements;
5. Assurance that the executable will function with modified versions of the library that maintain API compatibility.

**Method C — Documented Relinking Process:**
Provide written, step-by-step instructions that enable a person with ordinary software development skills to:
1. Obtain or compile a modified version of the Covered Code;
2. Link or integrate the modified Covered Code with other components of the executable;
3. Produce a functional executable with the modifications;
4. Install and execute the modified executable on appropriate target platforms.

The instructions must be sufficiently detailed and accurate that following them produces a working result without requiring reverse engineering, cryptanalysis, or circumvention of technical protection measures.

**Prohibition on Technical Restrictions:**
You must not employ any technology, technique, or measure that prevents, inhibits, restricts, or substantially increases the difficulty of relinking the executable with modified Covered Code. Prohibited restrictions include but are not limited to:

- Code signing or digital signature requirements that cannot be satisfied by recipients;
- Cryptographic verification that validates only executables produced by You;
- Hardware-based restrictions such as locked bootloaders or secure enclaves that prevent execution of modified software;
- License activation systems that tie the executable to the original binary;
- Anti-tampering mechanisms that detect and prevent execution of modified binaries;
- Obfuscation techniques deliberately designed to impede modification;
- Legal terms such as end-user license agreements that prohibit modification or reverse engineering of the executable;
- Patent claims asserted against recipients who exercise relinking rights;
- Any technological measure subject to anti-circumvention provisions of copyright law (such as DMCA Section 1201) that restricts relinking.

**Permitted Technical Measures:**
The following technical measures do not violate the prohibition on technical restrictions, provided they do not prevent relinking by recipients who follow the provided instructions:

- Standard compiler optimizations that improve performance but do not intentionally obfuscate;
- Removal of debugging symbols from released binaries when full symbols are available in separate files;
- Use of standard platform security features such as address space layout randomization or stack protection;
- Cryptographic signing for authenticity verification when signing keys are provided to recipients or when the software functions with unsigned modified versions;
- Network protocol authentication where authentication credentials are documented and available to recipients.

**User Product Installation Information:**
If the executable is distributed for use on or with a User Product (any tangible personal property normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or devices incorporated into a dwelling), You must provide Installation Information sufficient to install and execute modified versions of the Covered Code on that User Product. Installation Information means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of the Covered Code on the User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must be sufficient to ensure that the modified version functions and has access to all the same features and functions as the original version.

**Timing Requirement:**
All relinking materials, instructions, and information must be provided simultaneously with distribution of the executable or within thirty days of recipient request. You must not delay provision of relinking information as a means of restricting recipient rights.

**Verification:**
Upon request by any recipient, You must provide reasonable assistance to verify that the relinking process functions as documented, including clarifying instructions and identifying any errors in documentation. You are not required to provide personalized technical support, but must correct systematic errors in provided relinking information.

7. NonCommercial Restriction — Scope and Clarification
------------------------------------------------------
All rights granted under this license are strictly limited to NonCommercial use as defined in Section 0. Commercial use is prohibited unless You obtain a separate Commercial License from the Licensor through the procedures specified in Section 13.

**Scope of Restriction:**
The NonCommercial restriction applies to all activities under this license including:
- Using the Work;
- Reproducing or copying the Work;
- Distributing the Work to others;
- Publicly displaying or performing the Work;
- Creating Adapted Material or modifying the Work;
- Distributing Adapted Material or modifications;
- Combining the Work with other software or materials;
- Providing services based on or incorporating the Work;
- Any other exercise of rights under this license.

**Distribution Fees:**
You may charge fees in connection with distribution of the Work only to recover Direct Distribution Costs as defined in Section 0. Such fees must:
- Not exceed documented, actual costs directly attributable to the specific distribution;
- Be limited to media costs, shipping fees, bandwidth charges, and directly attributable infrastructure costs;
- Exclude all labor, overhead, profit margins, development costs, support costs, and indirect costs;
- Be disclosed transparently to recipients with itemization upon request.

Charging fees beyond Direct Distribution Costs constitutes commercial use requiring a Commercial License.

**Safe Harbor Amount:**
As a safe harbor provision, fees not exceeding twenty United States dollars (USD $20.00) or equivalent in other currencies per distribution unit are presumed to be Direct Distribution Costs and do not require itemization. Fees exceeding this amount require documentation if challenged.

**Advertising and Sponsorship:**
Use of the Work in any context where advertising revenue, sponsorship income, or other indirect monetization occurs constitutes commercial use unless:
- The Work is incidental to the primary content and not a significant revenue driver;
- All revenue is directed to a registered nonprofit charitable organization; or
- The use falls within the educational or research categories explicitly defined as NonCommercial in Section 0.

When uncertainty exists, presume the use is commercial and seek a Commercial License.

**Internal Business Use:**
Use of the Work by for-profit entities for internal research, development, testing, or evaluation purposes qualifies as NonCommercial only if:
- The Work is not integrated into products or services offered to customers;
- The Work does not contribute to revenue-generating operations or processes;
- The Work is not deployed in production environments serving customers or business operations;
- The use is genuinely experimental or developmental in nature.

Use that supports or enables commercial business operations requires a Commercial License even if the Work itself is not directly commercialized.

**Educational and Research Use:**
Academic and research use at accredited nonprofit educational institutions qualifies as NonCommercial even when industry-sponsored or funded, provided:
- Research results are published openly or subject only to standard academic publication practices;
- The research is conducted pursuant to the institution's educational or research mission;
- The Work is not incorporated into commercial products being developed for industry partners;
- Any intellectual property created using the Work remains with the educational institution or is published openly.

Corporate research facilities, private for-profit research institutions, and research conducted directly by commercial entities for product development purposes do not qualify as NonCommercial even if results are published.

**Government Use:**
Use by government entities at the federal, state, local, or tribal level for governmental purposes qualifies as NonCommercial. Use by government contractors or use in connection with commercial government contracts requires evaluation based on whether the ultimate purpose is commercial advantage or public service. When uncertain, government contractors should seek clarification through the procedures in Section 13.

**Nonprofit Organizations:**
Use by organizations that are registered as tax-exempt charitable organizations under the applicable jurisdiction's tax laws qualifies as NonCommercial when the use directly furthers the organization's charitable purposes. Use by organizations that call themselves "nonprofit" but are not registered as tax-exempt charitable organizations requires individual evaluation.

**Determining Commercial Status:**
When evaluating whether a use is commercial, consider:
- The primary purpose and intent of the use;
- Whether monetary compensation flows directly or indirectly from the use;
- Whether the use is integral to revenue-generating activities;
- Whether the user is operating as a commercial entity;
- Whether the use provides competitive advantage in commercial markets;
- Whether the use would reasonably be understood as commercial in ordinary business understanding.

**Requesting Clarification:**
If You are uncertain whether Your intended use qualifies as NonCommercial, You should request written clarification from the Licensor using the procedures in Section 13 before proceeding with the use. The Licensor may provide guidance, or may require a Commercial License depending on the circumstances. Use without clarification when uncertainty exists is undertaken at Your own risk.

8. Patent Grant and Defensive Termination
-----------------------------------------
**Patent License Grant:**
Subject to the terms of this license, each contributor to the Work who holds patent rights necessary to use, modify, or distribute the Work hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to NonCommercial uses and only to those patent claims licensable by such contributor that are necessarily infringed by the Work alone or by the Work in combination with modifications You make under this license.

**Scope Limitation:**
The patent license granted herein:
- Applies only to NonCommercial use; commercial use requires a separate Commercial License that includes appropriate patent grants;
- Does not extend to patent claims that would be infringed only by modifications made by third parties, or by combinations with third-party software not contemplated by the Work;
- Does not grant rights under patents for technologies or methods that are used in conjunction with the Work but are not part of the Work itself.

**Patent Litigation Termination:**
If You institute patent litigation against any entity including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit alleging that the Work or any Covered Code incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then all patent licenses granted to You under this Section 8 terminate immediately as of the date such litigation is filed.

This termination provision applies regardless of whether the patent litigation claim is ultimately successful. The termination is automatic and requires no notice from the Licensor.

**Defensive Patent Claims:**
If You bring patent litigation against an entity solely in response to that entity first initiating patent litigation against You regarding the Work, such defensive patent litigation does not trigger the termination provisions of this Section. A patent claim qualifies as defensive only if:
- The other entity filed patent litigation against You regarding the Work before You filed Your claim;
- Your claim is asserted against the same entity that initiated litigation against You;
- Your claim relates to the same Work or Covered Code that is the subject of the litigation initiated against You;
- Your claim is filed within one year of the litigation initiated against You.

**Patent Licensing for Modified Versions:**
If You distribute Modified Covered Code and You hold patents that would be necessarily infringed by the use of Your modifications, You grant all recipients a patent license under the same terms as this Section 8 for NonCommercial use of those modifications.

**No Obligation to Pursue Patents:**
Nothing in this license creates any obligation for any party to file, prosecute, or maintain patent applications or issued patents. The patent license granted herein applies only to patents actually held or controlled by contributors.

9. Warranties, Disclaimers, and Limitation of Liability
------------------------------------------------------
**Disclaimer of Warranties:**
Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing by the Licensor, the Work is provided strictly on an "AS IS" basis, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.

- Damages for loss of goodwill;
- Work stoppage;
- Computer failure or malfunction;
- Loss of data or data corruption;
- Loss of profits or revenue;
- Business interruption;
- Cost of substitute goods or services;
- Any and all other commercial damages or losses;

even if the Licensor or contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

**Jurisdiction-Specific Limitations:**
Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain warranties or liabilities, particularly for consumer products, personal injury, or death caused by negligence. In such jurisdictions, the exclusions and limitations set forth in this Section 9 shall apply to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. Where specific mandatory consumer protection laws apply, nothing in this license shall be interpreted to exclude or limit warranties or liabilities that cannot be excluded or limited under such laws.

**No Support Obligation:**
The Licensor is under no obligation to provide support, maintenance, updates, bug fixes, or modifications for the Work. Any support that is provided is provided on a voluntary basis at the sole discretion of the Licensor.

**Third-Party Rights:**
The disclaimers and limitations in this Section 9 also apply for the benefit of any contributors to the Work who are not the Licensor, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.

10. Termination and Cure
-----------------------
**Automatic Termination for Material Breach:**
Your rights under this license terminate automatically and immediately, without notice from the Licensor, upon Your material breach of any term of this license. Material breaches include but are not limited to:
- Commercial use without obtaining a Commercial License;
- Failure to provide required attribution;
- Failure to apply ShareAlike terms to Adapted Material or Modified Covered Code;
- Failure to provide Corresponding Source when required;
- Failure to enable relinking when distributing executables;
- Imposition of technical restrictions prohibited by Section 6;
- Assertion of patent litigation as described in Section 8;
- Removal or alteration of license notices or copyright information;
- Distribution with additional restrictions that limit recipient rights.

**Cure Period for Non-Willful Breaches:**
If Your breach was not willful and You had no reasonable basis to believe You were in breach, You may cure the breach and reinstate Your rights under this license by:
1. Ceasing all violations immediately upon discovering or being notified of the breach;
2. Taking all reasonable steps to remedy the breach within thirty days of discovery or notice;
3. Providing written notice to the Licensor, using the contact information in Section 13, describing:
   - The nature of the breach;
   - The steps taken to remedy the breach;
   - Assurance that the breach will not recur;
4. Making reasonable efforts to remedy the effects of the breach on downstream recipients.

If You satisfy these cure requirements within the thirty-day cure period, Your rights under this license are automatically reinstated as of the date the breach was fully cured. Reinstatement is provisional and conditional upon no recurrence of the same or similar breach.

**No Cure for Willful Breaches:**
No cure opportunity is available for breaches that were willful, deliberate, or undertaken with knowledge that the conduct violated this license. Willful breaches result in permanent termination of all rights under this license. Determination of whether a breach was willful shall be based on objective evidence of Your knowledge and intent at the time of the breach.

**No Cure for Repeated Breaches:**
If You have previously breached and cured on two prior occasions within a three-year period, You are not entitled to cure any subsequent breach. The third breach within three years results in permanent termination regardless of intent.

**Effect of Termination:**
Upon termination of Your rights under this license:
- You must immediately cease all use, copying, distribution, and modification of the Work;
- You must remove or destroy all copies of the Work in Your possession or control;
- You must cease distributing any Adapted Material or Modified Covered Code based on the Work;
- Any sublicenses You have granted to third parties under the ShareAlike provisions continue in effect provided those third parties remain in compliance with the license terms;
- Termination does not relieve You of liability for breaches that occurred prior to termination;
- Termination does not limit any other remedies available to the Licensor under applicable law.

**Downstream Recipients:**
Termination of Your rights does not affect the rights of downstream recipients who obtained the Work or Adapted Material from You, provided those recipients remain in compliance with this license. Each recipient receives their license directly from the Licensor, not from You as an intermediary.

**Survival of Obligations:**
Sections 4 (Attribution), 9 (Warranties and Liability), 11 (Indemnification), 12 (Governing Law), and any other sections that by their nature should survive termination continue in effect after termination of this license.

11. Indemnification
-----------------
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Licensor and all contributors from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from or related to:
- Your use, modification, or distribution of the Work;
- Your breach of any term of this license;
- Your violation of any third-party rights including intellectual property rights, privacy rights, or publicity rights;
- Any claim that Your use, modification, or distribution of the Work caused injury or damage to any third party;
- Any defects, errors, or vulnerabilities in modifications You make to the Work that cause harm to third parties.

This indemnification obligation applies regardless of whether the claims arise in contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or any other legal theory, and applies even if You did not intend to cause harm or were unaware that harm might result.

This indemnification does not apply to claims that arise solely from the Work as provided by the Licensor without modification by You, and where You have complied with all terms of this license.

12. Governing Law and Jurisdiction
---------------------------------
**Choice of Law:**
This license and all disputes arising from or relating to this license, the Work, or Your use of the Work shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of State of New York, USA, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

If no jurisdiction is specified by the Licensor in the LICENSE file distributed with the Work, then this license shall be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where the Licensor is domiciled or, for corporate Licensors, where the Licensor's principal place of business is located.

**Jurisdiction and Venue:**
Any legal action or proceeding arising from or relating to this license, the Work, or Your use of the Work shall be brought exclusively in the courts located in State of New York, USA, and You hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts.

If no jurisdiction is specified by the Licensor, then venue shall lie in the courts of the jurisdiction where the Licensor is domiciled or maintains its principal place of business.

**Waiver of Jury Trial:**
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, You and the Licensor each waive any right to a jury trial in any proceeding arising out of or relating to this license.

**International Application:**
This license is intended to be enforceable worldwide. If any provision of this license is held to be unenforceable or invalid under the laws of any particular jurisdiction, such provision shall be interpreted to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law in that jurisdiction, and the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.

13. Commercial Licensing and Contact Information
----------------------------------------------
**Commercial Use Prohibited Without License:**
All rights granted under this license are limited to NonCommercial use. If You wish to use, modify, or distribute the Work for commercial purposes as defined in Section 0, You must obtain a separate Commercial License from the Licensor.

**Commercial License Requests:**
To request a Commercial License or to obtain clarification regarding whether Your intended use qualifies as NonCommercial, contact the Licensor using the following information:

**Primary Contact:**
Email: johnwebdisplays@gmail.com
Subject Line: "JACX-ANCSA-R Commercial License Request" or "JACX-ANCSA-R Use Clarification"

**Required Information for License Requests:**
When requesting a Commercial License, please provide:
1. Your name and organization;
2. Contact information including email and postal address;
3. A detailed description of Your intended commercial use;
4. The components of the Work You intend to use;
5. Your anticipated distribution volume or revenue;
6. Your desired license term and scope;
7. Any specific terms or accommodations You are requesting.

**Response Timeline:**
The Licensor will make reasonable efforts to respond to Commercial License requests within thirty business days of receipt. Response times may be longer for complex requests or during periods of high volume. Failure to receive a response within thirty days does not grant any rights beyond those in this license.

**General Inquiries:**
For general questions about this license, clarification of terms, or reporting violations, contact the Licensor using the same contact information above.

**No Rights Without Agreement:**
Requesting a Commercial License does not grant any rights to use the Work commercially. You must not use the Work for commercial purposes unless and until You have received a signed Commercial License agreement from the Licensor. Use without proper authorization constitutes a material breach of this license and may subject You to legal liability.

14. Practical Compatibility Warnings
-----------------------------------
**Distribution Limitations:**
This license combines NonCommercial restrictions with copyleft provisions (ShareAlike) and relinking requirements for software. This combination creates known compatibility challenges:

*Package Managers and Distributions:*
Most major software distribution channels, including Linux distributions, language package managers (npm, pip, Maven, etc.), and app stores, have policies that prohibit or discourage NonCommercial licenses. Work licensed under JACX-ANCSA-R may not be acceptable for inclusion in these channels.

*Commercial Ecosystem Integration:*
Software licensed under this license cannot be integrated into commercial products without a separate Commercial License. This limits adoption in commercial software ecosystems and may prevent use in many professional software development contexts.

*License Incompatibility:*
The NonCommercial restriction is incompatible with most free and open source licenses including GNU GPL, MIT, Apache, BSD, and similar licenses. You cannot combine Covered Code licensed under JACX-ANCSA-R with code under those licenses in a way that creates a derivative work, as the ShareAlike requirement would require applying incompatible JACX-ANCSA-R terms to the entire work.

*Dual Licensing Recommendation:*
If broad adoption is desired, consider dual-licensing the Work:
- Use JACX-ANCSA-R for NonCommercial use;
- Offer commercial licenses for commercial use;
- Consider offering the software under a different free/open source license (such as Mozilla Public License 2.0 for code and Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike for assets) for those who want broader freedom.

Alternatively, consider using separate licenses for creative assets and software components:
- Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International for assets;
- Mozilla Public License 2.0 or GNU Lesser General Public License for code.

This separation resolves many compatibility issues while preserving attribution and source availability requirements.

**User Considerations:**
Before choosing to use this license for Your work, carefully consider:
- Whether the NonCommercial restriction aligns with Your goals;
- Whether You are prepared to administer Commercial License requests;
- Whether the distribution limitations are acceptable for Your use case;
- Whether Your target audience will be able to work within the NonCommercial constraints;
- Whether You would benefit from broader adoption under less restrictive terms.

15. Amendments and Future Versions
---------------------------------
**License Versions:**
The Licensor may publish revised or new versions of the JACX Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike Relinking License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.

**Applying License Versions:**
Unless otherwise specified by the Licensor, You may use the Work under the terms of the version of the license under which You originally received the Work, or under the terms of any later version published by the Licensor.

**Specifying Applicable Version:**
The Licensor may specify that the Work is licensed under a specific version of this license "only" by including language such as "JACX-ANCSA-R v2.0 only" in the license notice. In such cases, You may not use later versions without explicit permission.

If the Work specifies "JACX-ANCSA-R v2.0 or later" or similar language, You may use any later published version of this license at Your option.

**No Authority to Modify:**
No one other than the Licensor has authority to modify, amend, or create derivative versions of this license. Any purported modifications by third parties are void and ineffective.

17. Interpretation and Severability
----------------------------------
**Good Faith Interpretation:**
This license shall be interpreted in good faith to effectuate the Licensor's intent to permit NonCommercial use while preserving attribution, source availability, and relinking rights, and to prohibit commercial use without a separate Commercial License.

**Ambiguity Resolution:**
In the event of ambiguity in any provision of this license, the ambiguity shall be resolved in favor of:
1. The interpretation that preserves maximum rights for NonCommercial recipients;
2. The interpretation that is most consistent with the purposes stated in the Preamble;
3. The interpretation that provides the Licensor with maximum control over commercial exploitation.

**Severability:**
If any provision of this license is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable while preserving its intent, or if such modification is not possible, such provision shall be severed from this license. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision, and the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.

**Headings:**
Section headings are for convenience only and shall not affect the interpretation of this license.

**Entire Agreement:**
This license constitutes the entire agreement between You and the Licensor regarding the Work and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous understandings or agreements, written or oral, regarding such subject matter.
